# PDE (Partial Differential Equation) Numerical Solver for Wave Equation
## 2D Drum Membrane Simulation

The following materials were created as didactical tools for an Introductory Python Course at Technische Universität München.

Both Jupyter Notebooks will help Python beginners get a grasp of the inner workings of the code. For Python users these 2 Jupyter Notebooks might still be very relevant, because they present a very superficial introduction into the physical principles and the numerics behind solving the problem of a wave propagating in space.

The actual animation of the propagating wave can be created through the python script *wave_equation.py* inside the Python_scripts folder.
